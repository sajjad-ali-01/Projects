# Student Management System

This repository contains the code for a Student Management System, which allows administrators, teachers, and students to manage student and teacher records. The system is implemented in C++ using oop(object oriented programing) concepts.

## Features

The Student Management System provides the following features:

1. **Administrator**: The administrator can perform the following tasks:
   - Add, update, and delete teacher records
   - View teacher details
   - Add, update, and delete student records
   - View student details

2. **Teacher**: The teacher can perform the following tasks:
   - Search for a student's details based on their roll number
   - Display all students' details
   - View their own information

3. **Student**: The student can perform the following tasks:
   - Search for their own details based on their roll number

4. **Login and Registration**: The system includes a login and registration functionality. New users can register with a default username and password provided by the administrator.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled executable to start the Student Management System.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through different options and perform various tasks.

## Additional Notes

- The Student and Teacher records are stored in separate text files (`Student.txt` and `teacher.txt`) as tab-separated values.
- The login credentials for all users are stored in `login.txt` in the format: `<username> <password>`.

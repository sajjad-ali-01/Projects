# C++ Projects

## Library Management System and Student Management System
This GitHub repository contains two C++ projects: a Library Management System and a Student Management System. These projects were developed to demonstrate different programming concepts and data structures.

### Library Management System
The Library Management System is a C++ project that showcases the implementation of various **data structures**, including **linked lists**, **queues**, **binary search trees (BST)**, and **hashing**. It allows users to manage a library's book collection efficiently.

### Student Management System
The Student Management System is a C++ project that demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts. It allows administrators to manage student records efficiently.

## Usage

Both projects are implemented in C++ and can be compiled and executed on compatible systems. To run the projects, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the appropriate project folder (Library Management System or Student Management System).

2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

3. Execute the generated binary to launch the respective system.

## Contribution

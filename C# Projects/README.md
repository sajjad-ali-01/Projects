 # C# Projects

This repository contains two simple calculators implemented in **C#**: a basic **calculator** and a **GPA (Grade Point Average) calculator**. The calculators are organized in separate folders within the repository.

### Contents

- **Simple Calculator**
- **GPA Calculator**

### Simple Calculator

The Simple Calculator is a Desktop application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The user is prompted to enter the numbers and choose the operation they want to perform.

**Features:**
- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers

### GPA Calculator

The GPA Calculator is a Desktop application that calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the user's input of grades and credit hours for each course. The GPA is a numeric representation of a student's academic performance, and this calculator simplifies the process of calculating it.

**Features:**
- Input of course names, grades, and credit hours
- Calculation of GPA based on the entered data
- Validation of grades and credit hours to ensure accuracy

### How to Run

To use either of the calculators, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the respective calculator's folder:

- For the Simple Calculator:
```
- [SimpleCalculator](https://github.com/sajjad-ali-01/Projects/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/Calculator)
```

- For the GPA Calculator:
```
- [GPACalculator](https://github.com/sajjad-ali-01/Projects/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/GPA%20Calculator)
```

3. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in **Visual Studio 2019** or your preferred C# development environment.

4. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

5. Run the application, and you will be presented with a user-friendly interface for each calculator.
